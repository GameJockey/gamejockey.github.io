<h1>FR: A Night To Remember</h1>


<p>Haven&rsquo;t written in ages. No, I&rsquo;m not out of the game. I&rsquo;m back in my 
shitty, little hometown. It&rsquo;s misery. But nonetheless, for 
the past two months, I&rsquo;ve been going out literally every single fucking 
day. I&rsquo;m fucking hungry. I want this shit.</p><p>Anyways, there are a few FRs I&rsquo;ll share these days, from this year, that 
were worth writing. For tonight I have something fresh that happened 
like three hours ago. Fuck, dude, the game will be the end of me&hellip;</p><p>Thank god I didn&rsquo;t stay at home tonight instead, as I sort of wanted to 
work and didn&rsquo;t expect much happening in the field. Little did I 
know&hellip;</p>
<p>[The girl in this field report is called Amy and will be featured in future field reports]</p>

<hr><p>August 8th, 2016 Monday (Written right after coming home)</p><p>Field Report: A Night To Remember</p><p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather regret doing something, than regret not doing it&rdquo;</em> &mdash;RSD Todd</p><h2>A Different Kind of Virginity</h2><p>It&rsquo;s just us now.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t felt this awkward in weeks.</p><p>I always thought of myself kind of beneath her. She and her friends were
too cool for me, so we&rsquo;ve never really hung out; I&rsquo;ve never had the 
balls to act normally around her.</p><p>She was so much better than me, so perfect in her loving, 
	  you-only-live-once, adventurous personality, unlike me, the little 
	  conservative, logical, chode boy. I&rsquo;ve always found ways to be that 
	  little fag in front of her.</p><p>I look at her amazing hips and ass, and wonder do I go home and cry 
	  myself to sleep, or awkwardly walk around pretending to type on my 
	  phone.</p><p>She&rsquo;s sits down and starts rolling a joint. I&rsquo;m awkwardly sitting on my 
	  bike, looking around, occasionally glancing at her. I awkwardly ask 
	  something, hoping she responds well. She does.</p><p>Slowly, I keep asking more questions about what she&rsquo;s doing with her 
	  life and shit, and start to joke around. I spark up and we have a 
	  somewhat fun conversation.</p><p>I feel relieved&mdash;she actually talks to me and doesn&rsquo;t think of me as a 
	  piece of shit who&rsquo;s so beneath her that I&rsquo;m not even worth her breath. 
	  This mental image I&rsquo;ve had of her is complete and utter bullshit. This 
	  unreachable, bitchy-towards-chodes amazing girl is just a silly, little 
	  girl, a silly, little, imperfect kid who just wants to have fun, not 
	  entertain value-leeching chodes.</p><p>As I&rsquo;m slowly unstifling, my bro arrives. At this point, I&rsquo;m at the 
	  cause of this whole interaction. I&rsquo;m the center of attention, I&rsquo;m the 
	  shit, and I know it.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip; Come on,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>I look her straight in the eye, marveling at her beauty, and think for a few seconds.</p><p>Fuck it, dude. If I was gonna do this with anyone <em>ever</em> in my life&mdash;I&rsquo;d 
	  choose her, and her only. She&rsquo;s the only girl that lives for those 
	  beautiful-but-brief moments, the only one that really knows how to be 
	  truly alive and fucking enjoy it fully.</p><p>She gives it to me with her sweet, sweet hands&mdash;and I take a puff. And a few more.</p><p><em>&ldquo;This could be Heaven or this could be Hell&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p><h2>Embracing The Unknown</h2><p>&ldquo;Just relax,&rdquo; she says laughingly.</p><p>I&rsquo;m shivering&mdash;it feels like it&rsquo;s minus twenty fucking degrees. I want 
	  her in my arms more than anything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted in my fucking life. 
	  But I&rsquo;m too much of a faggot to just hug her. I see in her eyes that 
	  she&rsquo;s fucking begging me to do it on the inside.</p><p>She plays Hotel California by Eagles on her phone and keeps on giggling. We hum along.</p><p>&ldquo;If your hoodie wasn&rsquo;t too small for me, I&rsquo;d ask you for it,&rdquo; I say. She laughs hysterically.</p><p>It&rsquo;s one of those moments right now. Those beautiful moments between two
	  lovers, little moments of us looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes, moments 
	  worth dying for. Moments that I&rsquo;ve been chasing my whole fucking life. 
	  Here&rsquo;s one: fucking take it.</p><p>Here we are, night, sitting next to each other, listening to beautiful, 
	  lovey-dovey music, both high, giggling like little happy kids, fucking 
	  living&mdash;and then I let us both down. I wanna cry right now, but I can&rsquo;t 
	  even do that.</p><p>I can just tell she wants it so much. Oh, if she knew how much I want it
	  too. I just smile and try to enjoy the moment, while simultaneously 
	  hating myself for not going for it.</p><p>We have fun. I&rsquo;m still shaking like a motherfucker from being cold.</p><p>She plays Rehab by Amy Winehouse and teases me that I need a rehab too.</p><p>I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve said &sbquo;no, no, no&rsquo;&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s like &sbquo;&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes&rdquo;
	  while laughing at me. I realize that even now in this amazing moment, 
	  I&rsquo;m being a logical, conservative little fag who can&rsquo;t enjoy the fucking
	  moment by saying I regret doing it. I fucking don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m just a goddamn
	  pussy.</p><p>At one point she says how she loves this joy of being high, just 
	  giggling and enjoying it all. I feel like I fucking ruined it for her by
	  being dumb.</p><p>I keep thinking about ways to escalate but I just fucking can&rsquo;t. The 
	  best &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; I&rsquo;m coming up with is that I&rsquo;m cold and that I need her to
	  warm me up. Occasionally, she would touch my shoulder as she&rsquo;s talking 
	  but I never really knew how to touch her, and not have it be awkward.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, will these guys leave already, &rdquo; I say, referring to her little 
	  brother and some dudes we know, who are hanging out nearby, likely even 
	  listening to our conversation, knowing them and their jealousy of me 
	  suddenly hanging out with her.</p><p>They actually start leaving right then. She sees her little brother 
	  leaving with them, jumps up, mumbles something totally nonsensical like,
	  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get home after my brother, see ya,&rdquo; and literally storms off 
	  without a giving a single fuck.</p><p>I&rsquo;m just sitting there by myself, staring at her, at them all leaving me
	  by myself like I&rsquo;m not even here. What in the actual fuck just 
	  happened?!</p><p>I feel confused, and I feel very used. She enjoyed my company and then just ditched me in a heartbeat.</p><p>I ride my bike, roaming the town for about half an hour just processing this, trying not to think of what the hell that was.</p><p>Fuck my life&hellip;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what was that? There are a few possible explanations to this, and 
	  the one that makes the most sense to me right now is that she doesn&rsquo;t 
	  want those guys to think that &ldquo;oh there she goes fucking yet another 
	  dude.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the most likely reason why.</p><p>Another one is that she actually doesn&rsquo;t want to be totally one-on-one 
	  with me for whatever reason. We had a good time though, so I don&rsquo;t see 
	  why would she hesitate. Maybe she&rsquo;s just fucking pissed that I was a 
	  chode, I would be. I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>So, checking Facebook after coming home, she most likely went out to a 
	  nearby town to a bar with her friends right after ditching me, to drink 
	  and party with her crew. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t be obsessing over it, and 
	  I&rsquo;m certainly not, but yeah, I feel used by her.</p><p>I know, I am a chode right now. Fuck this shit, I&rsquo;m better than that.</p><p>My confidence used to be fucking divine, I mean, I was the coolest 
	  motherfucker ever, I was a true fucking unshakable god of all and there 
	  was fucking nothing that could make me question myself, but in the last 
	  few months, being without a proper purpose and path in life, I feel 
	  fucking lost and my confidence has waned. I need to cut this fucking 
	  faggotry out and be a goddamn god that I am.</p><p>Anyways, I need to work on this shit. Fuck it. I&rsquo;m a mess right now. I&rsquo;m
	  cutting into my sleep to write this, just because &ldquo;I love her so much 
	  and fuck everything else, she&rsquo;s worth it all,&rdquo; which is exactly why I&rsquo;m a
	  chode these days. Purpose over women is what drives true confidence. I 
	  sorta lack that shit these days.</p><p>There&rsquo;s far too much emotional faggotry in this report, but what can I do, being a man is hard when you&rsquo;re a chode.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent far too much time writing this shit so I&rsquo;m gonna stop myself 
	  right here and head to bed. I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t even wanna sleep, dreaming about 
	  shit will just poke that wound even more. Fuck it.</p><p>Also, here&rsquo;s a few songs that match the vibe of how disappointed, and 
	  &ldquo;in love&rdquo; I feel right now, because why the fuck not. This is also what I
	  listened to as I wrote this to match my miserable mood:</p><ul>

	  </ul>
	  <p>I&rsquo;ll do whatever it fucking takes for this. I already said it many times
	  in my past FRs. I&rsquo;m willing to fucking die for this shit. Go all out.</p>
<p>Wish me some goddamn luck. Cheers.</p>
