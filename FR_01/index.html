<h1>The Beginnings</h1>
<p>This post is adapted from my original forum post on RSDNation, which is my very first FR I ever wrote. Most of the post is intact—just as it was when I wrote it. Only a few minor spelling and readability improvements have been made.</p>
<p>Written on May 13th, 2015.</p>
<hr />
<p>Welcome, my fellow brothers.</p>
<p>I intend to keep a thread here as if I was writing a book—in-depth style. Think Jeffy’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Nine Ball</em> except less crazy shit during the first few months. But a cool writing style nonetheless.</p>
<p>So, I want you to think of it as a book. And you’re watching the story unfold before your eyes.</p>
<p>I intend to hold <em>nothing</em> back; brutal honesty. This isn’t the place to be a liar I used to be just to gratify my little ego and brag. I don’t care if you know me and don’t like what I write here, I’m sorry, but there’s no sugar-coating it.</p>
<p>Please note: the background sounds chody as fuck here and there, but really, I am truly expressing how I feel about the events I’m describing. IRL, I’m actually a pretty cool dude if you know me. I just like to write with a dramatical, at times sarcastic, and highly expressive style. Just to fully portray how I internally feel about these events.</p>
<p>Also, skip the background if ya’ want. It’s here just to provide some context to my field reports.</p>
<h4 id="a-bit-of-background">A Bit of Background</h4>
<p>I’m a dude in my twenties, “fresh meat” in this game. Discovered RSD 21 months ago in my small town, transformed myself, my career, self-esteem, diet and work ethic, yet haven’t gotten further than getting a fucking high five during my time in the game—literally.</p>
<p>I don’t smoke nor have I ever been high on any drug. But I do try to consciously induce “semi-highs” by placing myself in emotionally intense situations: lucid dreaming, crazy experiences, and of course, game. I used to drink a bit for fun with my bros before I knew about game. Not anymore. Sober game is the only acceptable game.</p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>
<h4 id="story-time-my-first-open2">Story Time: My First Open<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></h4>
<p>For the very first time in my life, about four months after discovering the game, I have opened a girl. Two of ’em, more precisely. I was (sorta) going to college at the time, so it was the first time I was living on my own in a new and big city.</p>
<p>I was 18 at the time.</p>
<p>In the late evening hours of a lovely warm night of January 9th, 2014, I ran into a two-set<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> on my happy stroll back home from an emergency room in a hospital after having another panic attack. After in-depth examination by a few sexy nurses and a doctor, it was concluded by all parties that my life sucks. I was urgently advised to visit a next-door mental hospital to “talk to someone”.</p>
<p>My blood was boiling.</p>
<p>As I walked next to the mental hospital, images of violent psychos like my uncle we used to live with started filling my mind’s eye. “I don’t belong here… What the fuck is happening to my world, my life, my dreams?”, I thought to myself with a tear in my eye. So naturally, I decided to open some bitches.</p>
<p>Fuck it.</p>
<p>I saw them. Them two hoes are mine. A big advertisement screen behind my two-set of lovely young ladies said exactly 22:18 and 30 seconds. At that moment, the sheer amount of cortisol, adrenaline and mental chaos shoved me into the set. Seconds before opening, I remember looking down at my bad-ass Converse shoes and thinking, “This is it, bro. It’s showtime.”</p>
<p>I opened asking for directions to music school with a smile. I listened to the lovely sound of her voice and looked straight into her eyes through her pretty glasses. I was melting from desire and love for women as I lost myself in her. Finally, we smiled at each other and parted. I felt a subtle sense of achievement and true fulfillment as I walked off.</p>
<p>The world didn’t explode that night.</p>
<p>Ah, the good old college days. Glad I dropped the fuck out only three months in.</p>
<p>I’m a dude with a shiny v-card, never kissed a girl nor held hands with one for more than it was required by a handshake. The most intimate experience I have had was getting a few hugs from a really hot girl who through some convoluted scenario became my semi-friend. She was a hot, sweet, lovely and caring girl with all of the best feminine qualities and a tinge of that sexy bitchiness she would sprinkle in here and there at appropriate times.</p>
<p>Once, after school, I ran into her in a park. She walked up, looked at me, said “hi” smiling, and asked me for some change. After giving her some, with those amazing dark eyes of hers, she looked deeply into mine.</p>
<p>I felt a sudden shift in the vibe.</p>
<p>In the fucking universe.</p>
<p>Slowly, her soul-crushingly soft and smooth hands touched my cheeks as she grabbed my face like I was about to get kissed.</p>
<p>Time came to a halt. I think half my brain died at that very second.</p>
<p>I heard the words I was willing to die and kill for. “I love you”, she uttered with a glaring smile on her sharp red stunning lips.</p>
<p>For that one moment of my pathetic life, I was in heaven. My soul melted as I cried inside.</p>
<p>Naturally, it went fucking nowhere as I was friend-zoned.</p>
<p>About two years later, we arrive back at me discovering RSD back in August 2013. I have hustled my fucking ass off to get my dream job only to realize that I don’t want it. I did follow my passion for 7 years now, mastered the shit out of it, but ended up using my skills for someone else’s projects. Fuck no. I’m at that job right now, making some dough to start a venture of my own.</p>
<p>So, that’s me. A relatively cool dude, hardcore hustler with sickening work ethic, yet a nerdy pick-up newbie.</p>
