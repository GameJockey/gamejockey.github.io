<h1 id="fr-second-open-ever">FR: Second Open Ever</h1>
<p>Adapted, and slightly improved for readability, from my FRs thread on RSDNation.</p>
<p>Happened on May 13th, 2015.</p>
<hr />
<p>These days, I have decided to go out as much as humanly possible, because I can. For a moment, I contemplated not going out because I was tired, but that thought got nuked before I could even finish saying it to myself. I HAVE DECIDED—IT SHALL BE DONE. With game being one of my core life values, I have a fucking raging fire of desire to get good at it.</p>
<p>After sitting at home preparing content for this thread, around 10:15pm I head out. I’m kinda scared, as usual. As I’m watching myself leave the building, I realize I’m actually fucking doing this.</p>
<p>I anxiously arrive to the main square and roll into the street filled solely with bars and clubs. Every time I walk about halfway into that street, I just start smiling inside like crazy because I know how fucking awesome the game is. How awesome this fucking city is and how my life will be awesome because of it. I am overwhelmed with a sense of gratefulness to Tyler, Julien, Brad, Jeffy and the rest of the glorious crew<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, there’s a serious fire under my ass and a sense of urgency heavily present in my mind.</p>
<p>In the following two and a half hours, I make myself stay as long as it fucking takes because I’m not going home without opening. Keep in mind that I haven’t cold-approached since that January 9th last year. But there is NO FUCKING WAY I’m backing out. I know that if I don’t open, I’d just realize how much of a piece of shit I am and probably have another panic attack because I just can’t fucking rationalize not opening. The veneer of lies and excuses has been taken off of my mind long time ago when I was having those panic attacks.</p>
<p>They were caused by me desperately digging underneath the layers of reality looking for an answer.</p>
<p>They were just a manifestation of me fully internalizing the essential truth of nature. Purposelessness of everything and the non-duality of human consciousness—the “unity”; the One Life. Embracing the chaotic nature of the universe FULLY. Like, truly internalizing deep down to the very last neuron in my brain that we’re just fucking quantum fluctuations and atoms acting in accordance with simple physical laws—non-duality and truth internalized.</p>
<p>Complete and utter obliteration of my reality.</p>
<p>Of everything—ever.</p>
<p>Life exists because of physics just like 1+1 equals two because of math. Same shit really. Life is nothing. Nothing matters nor it ever will. I reached true enlightenment that night before my first panic attack. (On that note, read yourself some Jed McKenna, guys!)</p>
<p>I snap back to reality in this moment and reach an ultimate conclusion.</p>
<p>Open or die—literally.</p>
<p>I’m in severe pain and tiredness. It’s around midnight and I have to be up at 7:20am every day. I know I’m fucking with my sleep at this point and the urgency to open and be done with this shit is immense.</p>
<p>My back is killing me from sitting 8h a day at my goddamn job, my feet are killing me from literally walking in circles for hours looking for “the perfect set”. I waste a few near perfect sets with ridiculous rationalizations. One was “I just can’t”. Mother of god…</p>
<p>In all that pain, I feel a sudden sense of gratefulness because of my currently 42 day streak of daily mindfulness meditation. I realize I can handle the pain. I do it in my meditation sessions daily as I purposefully expose myself to pain and meditate on it intensly. Piece of cake. It just fuels my drive and reminds me of the true nature of the world, of the ups and downs of the game.</p>
<p>For a moment, I am truly grateful for the down for I know the benefits it brings me. I enjoy the pain with a smile.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s around 00:20 and I’m walking back onto the main square. Damn it, I was JUST ABOUT TO TRY convincing myself to go home already.</p>
<p>But—nope.</p>
<p>For some reason I have a preference for two-sets. A blonde pushing a bike and her brunette friend walking along on the main square appear in my field of vision. Both hot. I see they’re having fun chatting.</p>
<p>I immediately know this is it. My brain just fucking locks onto them. There is no rationalization in the world that would make me not open. Literally impossible. Discussion done. I’d probably kill myself somehow right then and there if I didn’t open. Even if the world was ending right then and there, I would do it. My brain is hardwired so goddamn well from all this brainwashing I’ve done to it. I am grateful.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this, I feel the exact emotions as if I’m there again. As I’m getting closer, for shits and giggles, I look down at my Converse shoes just like in the old days and think to myself, “this is it, bro”. I take a deep breath, lift my head high, straighten my posture and go in.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to walk past them, I say “Hi.”</p>
<p>At this very moment, the world around me stops.</p>
<p>A motherfucking time-freeze. Reality melts right in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>I am trully unconscious. The ultimate autopilot mode.</p>
<p>At this point, I’m not doing. I’m watching myself do as I’m disassociated from reality completely.</p>
<p>I am in a crumbling lucid dream; time sways back and forth as I’m trying not to wake up.</p>
<p>Approximately 250 miliseconds later, I descend back into reality and spit the: “Do you guys know how to get to XXX”. They look at each other, mumble a few words I somewhat hear, say goodbye to each other, then the brunette says, “Yeah! I’m actually going there! Hey, you should come with me!”</p>
<p>BRAIN FRY OVER 9000. WHAT THE FUCK DID SHE JUST SAY?!?!</p>
<p>Complete and utter obliteration of conscious thought.</p>
<p>I have never felt more surprised, disassociated and unconscious in my entire fucking pathetic life. Yet, I remain somewhat composed and my behavior doesn’t reflect the true state of the inner soup that my brain is. I hesitantly say, “Awesome!” as we start to walk.</p>
<p>I am totally overwhelmed by a completely unexpected response as I was simply expecting an answer, not a fucking invitation to join her FOR A WALK. Jesus.</p>
<p>But I am grateful and feel lucky as fuck with this being my second set ever.</p>
<p>She actually starts fucking interacting with me—like, for real. She starts asking interview mode stuff and getting to know me. I’m confused as hell as I answer quite awkwardly. We are silent for a few seconds and I’m trying to think of what to say. (HA! Classic newbie shit right there.)</p>
<p>She asks, “You’re not really talkative, are you?”. In the most awkward tone I ever heard myself, I’m like “Hmm, I don’t know..” kinda trying to sound mysterious.</p>
<p>I laugh inside as I realize how absurdly pathetic that sounded.</p>
<p>She starts talking how she doesn’t like the building next to us, it doesn’t make sense in such a place. At this point I realize she’s completely oblivious to my inner mental chaos—purposefully ignoring it or not, I don’t even care.</p>
<p>I saw that as an opportunity to get my shit together and be myself again as opposed to regressing into the default chode behavior in confusing situations just like I did during this interaction.</p>
<p>I begin to behave more confidently and spit some answers at her. As we talk for a few seconds more, I start looking at her while she’s talking. But I notice something.</p>
<p>I notice SHE’S FUCKING NORMAL.</p>
<p>You know, like, normal?! Like, a regular fucking person, as if I knew her for years, just like, funny, cute and imperfect, y’know?</p>
<p>Brain fry again. Complete fucking paradigm shift.</p>
<p>There’s a brief pause in the interaction as I’m still processing this epiphany. I step up and decide to introduce myself. I look at her and say confidently, “I’m GameJockey”. She smiles and says “I’m A”. I melt at the awesomeness of her name as it reminds me of other girls named like her. At that moment, I kinda spring back into consciousness and realize how fucking gorgeous she really is. I was so overwhelmed throughout the interaction that I didn’t even see anything below her face. I have no idea was she any hot. I just <em>think</em> she had a black leather jacket on. And a glossy pink lipstick. But her face was pretty as fuck.</p>
<p>“So what are you studying”, I ask. She laughs and says “Haha, I’m 30 something, I finished studying long ago”. Bitch looks fucking 25 tops, I’m like LOL WTF. I love it.</p>
<p>We talk a bit about work and whatnot, and I lie like a fucking dog that I’m not from here trying to justify my retarded opener about directions.</p>
<p>We shortly thereafter arrive at the spot where we’re about to part. Without even looking into her eyes, I just mindlessly wander off and say “Bye, thanks a lot”. I tend to literally forget about eye contact in these unconscious situations. I have no problem holding eye contact whatsoever, when I’m conscious, that is.</p>
<p>In every single interaction with hot chicks I regret not holding eye contact because I JUST FUCKING FORGET TO in the heat of my confusion. I want to look at them because they’re fucking gorgeous, it would bring out that massive desire and love for women I have, remind me why the fuck do I really want her so bad and make me play to win no matter fucking what. Yet, I’ve never held ’nuff eye contact to reach that point. But I digress.</p>
<p>I walk home FUCKING EXHILLARATED. Greatest night of my life - almost. The greatest one was a few weeks ago when I was out with my wing that I just met, when I fully let go at the club and danced like crazy.</p>
<p>But that’s a story for another time, maybe.</p>
<p>As I walk into the bathroom back home and stare at myself in the mirror, I feel a deep sense of fulfillment and purpose for I took MASSIVE FUCKING ACTION IN SPITE OF HEAVY PAIN. I hammered my self to the bitter fucking end and got the open. Imagine if I went home JUST A SINGLE FUCKING MINUTE EARLIER. I might’ve opened someone else, but I definitely wouldn’t be fucking personally escorted to my destination.</p>
<p>Right now it’s May 14th, 8:27pm and I’m gonna go out today around 10pm as well—of course, despite being under-slept as fuck and in pain from last two days of roaming the streets solo.</p>
<p>This is the power of having a massive desire and tolerating ZERO BULLSHIT BEHAVIOR from myself. The last few times I went out during working days, I meditated at like 3am despite having to work early next day.</p>
<p>I FUCKING WANT THIS SHIT SO BAD and I’m comfortable with pain because I purposefully train my self for it in my meditation. That’s my secret to taking action. I’m willing to bleed for it; I’ve already bled and will keep pushing no matter fucking what. I know pain is easy to deal with at this point.</p>
<p>Wish me luck. And wish me some balls.</p>
<p>Here are some notes straight from my “PUA journal” in which I break down my nights every single time I come home::</p>
<pre><code>NEGATIVE
    -considered just giving up and going home (if I hadn&#39;t seen [Her Name] and her friend, I&#39;d have gone toward home and hoped to open someone on the way)
    -i was overwhelmed which caused me to:
        -not express intent after opening
        -not saying anything
            -just start it up with situational and interview mode stuffs
    -[Her Name] kinda led the interaction for me, but not my fault really (but ALWAYS take responsibility, I could&#39;ve started setting the rhythm)
    -I seemed nonsocial, she said &quot;[you&#39;re not very chatty/talkactive]&quot;
    -I fucking lied hahah
    -i was in massive pain. not sustainable for everyday habit.
    
POSITIVE
    -I FUCKING DID THE OPEN!!! Second deliberate cold approach open in my life!
    -I PUSHED MYSELF SO FUCKING MUCH thru so much pain
        -i was and still am in such a pain, feet and back, had to piss, tired as fuck, etc, BUT I FUCKING DID IT
        -I&#39;d like to thank meditation for that and my 42day streak!
    -[Her Name] TRULLY didn&#39;t give a shit about my [looks related insecurity] ONE BIT
    -she is SO NORMAL duh! like, once a switch in my mind went &quot;dude, she&#39;s just a normal person&quot;, then I actually started to ask questions and be more awesome!

LESSONS
    -play to win, not not to lose like you do by default
        -single most KEY ASPECT MY GAME IS MISSING
        -you know how to play to win, and you&#39;re sure it works, duh, endless infield and rsd vids, PLAY TO WIN IS WHAT WILL GET HER TRULLY
    -SET THE RHYTHM OF THE INTERACTION, Lead, introduce topics, FUCKING LEAD THE INTERACTION.
        -interview mode and situational stuff, with fluff and ACC (add to the fun, commanding, challenging) inbetween
    -intent:
        -start talking sexual/relationship stuff, u have a boyfriend, etc, you&#39;re really sexy tonight girl; making me think of bad things lol, along those lines, FUCKING LEGENDARY STUFF CAUSE ITS SO EASY YET GOOD!!
