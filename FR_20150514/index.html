<h1 id="fr-wtf-just-happened">FR: WTF Just Happened?!</h1>
<p>Adapted, and slightly improved for readability, from my FRs thread on RSDNation.</p>
<p>Happened on May 14th, 2015.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s raining cats and dogs. My wing wishes me luck on Facebook; he’s busy with college stuff these days. I look through the window I see quite a show—it’s a damn thunderstorm. I don’t even consider staying at home tonight. Subconscious personal boundaries at work right there. For a moment I get scared I might get struck by lighting because of the umbrella. I laugh at the thought and sail out with just a fucking T-shirt on.</p>
<p>The city looks awesome during such a rainy night. Bars and streets are filled with quite a bit of people even though it’s Thursday at 10:30pm.</p>
<p>As I walk through the main square toward the street with bars and clubs, I enjoy the vibe of the night. I decide to go along my already usual route. People often lock eyes with me for whatever reason and it’s rather interesting—I do have a bit of an unusual haircut, but still..</p>
<p>I enter a more quiet street and keep walking. At this point, it’s around 10 minutes since I left the house. A few minutes later, I cross the road and then BAM.</p>
<p>I spot her.</p>
<p>But this time it’s different.</p>
<p>This bitch’s a ten—like, straight up a fucking stunner. I immediately see the bitchy attitude from like 100ft/30m away just by the way she dresses. Obnoxiously hot high heels are usually a dead giveaway. Blonde, tight-ass jeans, a leather jacket, red lipstick; all the “HB10” characteristics are there.</p>
<p>My brain goes, “bro, this is the one”. I’m just like “ahh, no way dude…”</p>
<p>So I’m standing next to the zebra crossing for like two seconds already and I need to make a damn decision. Do I change my direction and cross the street to open her? Or do I out and keep walking just to find myself pushing myself for hours on end looking for “a better and eaiser” situation and not giving up like I did yesterday.</p>
<p>FUCK IT. I cross the street.</p>
<p>She’s been standing in front of a bar alone staring at her phone all this time, so she didn’t even see me. As I’m getting closer, I get this strange intense numbing feeling in my legs and a pretty solid adrenaline spike.</p>
<p>Dudes, it’s getting intense.</p>
<p>I become present and fully immerse in the feeling of my approach anxiety. I let it wash over me as if I was passing through sleep paralysis seconds before entering a lucid dream. In fact, it felt EXACTLY like that, if not even more intense.</p>
<p>My heart is relatively calm as I’ve been doing heart rate variability training, but shit man, I’m wrecked inside.</p>
<p>As I’m getting closer, I’m coming to a realization that “holy shit, I’m actually gonna do this”. The peak of anxiety has been reached. I’m done.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I’m in.</p>
<p>I say “Hi.”</p>
<p>I wait.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Zero reaction.</p>
<p>I don’t exist.</p>
<p>Deafening silence fills my ears.</p>
<p>I start losing my shit as she keeps staring at her phone obliviously.</p>
<p>WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??</p>
<p>About two full seconds after my “hi”, she finally slowly brings her eyes to me.</p>
<p>Whew…..</p>
<p>First of all, I realize how close to her I am for some reason. I am quite a bit up in her face, like 35cm/a foot. Is this some subconscious primal beta behavior that automatically came up? Like, what the fuck, dude? Anyways, she seems to not mind it nor notice it—and I’m actually surprised by it positively.</p>
<p>I throw out my already classic, retarded, indirect question in a very chody way in spite of all the eye contact: “Do you know where is XXX; how to get there?”</p>
<p>I realize what the fuck have I just done.</p>
<p>I realize exactly the kind of reaction I’m going to get.</p>
<p>She looks at me blankly dead in the eye, then nonchalantly as fuck says, “I don’t know; really”.</p>
<p>WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THIS WOMAN??</p>
<p>At this point I am taken the fuck aback by her lack of engagement in the interaction; not even fake politeness is there. No smiles. No fun and games. Nothing. Just like that.</p>
<p>A cold hearted bitch. Damn, she was hot.</p>
<p>I am really unsure how to deal with this, so naturally, I prepare to eject like a bitch.</p>
<p>I say something like “ooh-kay then” in a severely confused and insecure sounding tonality and walk away with my head down.</p>
<p>At first I was kinda happy because, fuck, like, I opened literally one of the hottest bitches I’ve seen this week. But then, I started identifying with a chode newbie again and felt like a piece of shit; she didn’t wanted to give me a god damn time of day—for no apparent reasons on my part.</p>
<p>I roamed more as it would’ve been kick-ass if I could open another set.</p>
<p>Well, let me spoil it for ya’: I didn’t.</p>
<p>I saw like two sets that I could’ve gone for, but didn’t for god knows why. I guess I just didn’t feel the fire under my ass to do it as I’ve just done one and it’s been the most intense of all my opens so far. But in reality, it’s nothing special: I walk up, we exchange a few words and I leave. If only my emotions worked like that.</p>
<p>I came home. I realized a few things.</p>
<p>Basically, if I was in a dominant zone, if I was, say, out with my wing and in state, I’d handle this shit really well. There would be no need to do brainwashing delusional reframes.</p>
<p>But when I’m out solo, there’s still a lot of that mentality like, “I’m a newbie chode low value kid, how the fuck could I ever even consider being with a bitchy ten like her, she fucks only the top of the top dudes and ignores others completely”</p>
<p>When I’m with my wings and friends and such, I feel like a boss and just great. But by myself trying to do night street game, not so much.</p>
<p>In reality, a simple push would’ve gotten her all over me. I’m just too inexperienced and therefore afraid to do any direct stuff. Logically, I know it would make for a great attraction spike, but my brains blocks that behavior from me for the lack of proper first-hand references to back up the safety of its execution.</p>
<p>Anyways, tomorrow I’m heading out to meet a new dude from our Inner Circle. We’ll meet for some (non-alcoholic) drinks, and then hit the club.</p>
<p>I’m psyched.</p>
