<hr />
<p>Greatest weekend <em>EVER</em> and my first club open that failed miserably—a real man’s blowout.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As usual, I’m at work browsing the interwebz and hating life. Some dude randomly hits me up on FB and tells me he’s coming to my city and wants to go out. Now, random dudes hit me up constantly on FB, I’ve met online so many awesome fucking people from RSD Inner Circles, it’s ridiculous. So I check his profile and see this free pickup event he’s going to and notice it’s in my fucking city. I’m like dafuq??</p>
<p>I start hitting people up and see it’s actually legit. Some pickup instructors I’ve never heard of are actually doing a two day event 5 minutes away from my place in a hotel. My wing tells me Neil even mentioned these guys in The Game. Best part—it’s free! Shit man, this sounds awesome. I see dudes from all over are flying in specifically for this event. We decide to go.</p>
<p>I’m psyched as fuck, I’ve never even been to a hotel before. I came home, sat down and took a look at my life. Who the fuck am I? I’m just a weird, awkward computer nerd from a small town who rose up from fucking nothing to this. All thanks to self-development, RSD and the power of hustle and desire to be the top 1%.</p>
<p>I’m sitting in a huge bad-ass city with a killer high-paying job (by average people’s standards, but not mine), going to hotels on fancy conferences. I’m meeting dudes from all over the world and going out to PICK UP WOMEN with them. I realize how fucking incredible and unbelievable this sounds. I ACTUALLY FUCKING LIVE THIS. If I told this to any of my old friends, 99% of ’em would laugh in my face because they think it’d be a completely ridiculous lie. I’d take it as a compliment. “My life is legendary,” I think to myself.</p>
<p>If someone told me 3 years ago this would be my life, I’d punch him in the face for making me feel bad about myself (nah, I wouldn’t have the balls for it).</p>
<p>So [the event day] comes and we roll out to the event. It’s fucking epic, I walk into the hotel and I feel just amazing. You know that “I actually fucking made it” feeling (I hope you do)? That’s it.</p>
<p>I realize I REALLY fucking (somewhat) made it. Oh my god…..</p>
<p>We get there and there’s loads of dudes from all over the world, I chatted with some of ’em online and it’s amazing. I’m happy as fuck to also be speaking English for the first time with some outsiders. I think, write and live in English. I actually really dislike my native language because I’ve developed my English to a much higher level.</p>
<p>So we go through the talk and it’s great. Dude starts with basics, how attraction works, social conditioning, yada yada, classical solid pickup fundamentals. They’re actually on point. No routines or bullshit, actual solid pickup theory just like RSD.</p>
<p>We do some exercises, spin hugs and shit like that, some verbal exercises like improv and whatnot. It’s fun. I like these dudes.</p>
<p>The day is coming to an end and the instructors tell us we’re going out tonight together, they’re getting us in a kick-ass high-end club that I’ve fucking dreamed of getting into and I’m like WHAAAAA</p>
<p>He tells us that this club is gonna be the ultimate test of our self-esteem. There’s no middle ground—you’re either gonna burn and walk home in tears or you’ll fucking dominate like a god.</p>
<p>I am so fucking exhilarated; I can’t breathe of excitement and I can’t fucking wait to see this place—and fucking GAME there. Oh my god, I am the happiest man in the world.</p>
<p>We part, night comes, I meet up with my wing, and we drive there. I’m fucking tired and nervous always before going out, but this is some serious top level shit so I’m psyched out of my mind.</p>
<p>As you might predict, pure glory ensues.</p>
<h2 id="the-club">The Club</h2>
<p>We arrive in front of the club where we find one of the instructors outside. We chat a bit and he says I’m dressed like shit. I actually am because I don’t have any good clothes—I just ain’t got ’nuff incentive to go find good stores and go buy some.</p>
<p>I laugh it off and we walk towards the entrance. He tells to the chick at the door (which he actually fucked from what I’ve heard) that he’s with all of us. There’s like ten dudes he’s gonna get in lol.</p>
<p>We walk in and I just melt in the glory.</p>
<p>As we go through the door, I realize how fucking amazing this place is. There’s stunning hot bitches dressed as nurses standing around the hallway saying “good evening” and smiling flirtatiously.</p>
<p>I’m blown away. “Is this what all the top clubs look like? Oh my god, SO MUCH YESSSSS,” I think to myself.</p>
<p>We walk in, and there is this massive cool room with a bar and tables and after that, there’s the club.</p>
<p>In the club, I stop for a moment and take this in. The place is legendary. It’s massive. There is no roof so we see the night sky, the stars and, coincidentally, a full moon; there are gorgeous women literally everywhere. I can’t even…</p>
<p>Am I dreaming? Is this fucking heaven? I wanna stay here ’till the day I die.</p>
<p>I almost cried at how amazing this is.</p>
<p>We walk to the bar and my wing starts chattin’ to this badass dude from the seminar who’s successful, rich and banged loads of hoes. This keeps on going for like 15 minutes while I proceed to stand around and derp like an idiot ’cause I can’t hear a damn thing they’re saying. I just stare at the awesomeness and stunning women in front of me.</p>
<p>After a while, some dudes from the seminar start showing up and we start chatting. These guys are awesome.</p>
<p>Finally, me and my wing grab water (the official PUA drink lol) and we go to the dancefloor where the night begins.</p>
<h2 id="the-approaching">The Approaching</h2>
<p>We’re derping around dancing and chattin’ with other dudes. It’s time to go in. I want to fucking chat girls but I know I can’t really get myself to open.</p>
<p>There’s tons of two-sets everywhere. You can just smell it on them they’re there to get laid, it’s so obvious—or that’s just my perception. Regardless, it’s great.</p>
<p>One dude from the seminar is with us and we’re looking to approach. We find a three-set and go in. As usual, they go in, and I’m kinda dancing next to them while looking around and smiling.</p>
<p>It’s retarded and I know it damn well.</p>
<p>Finally, I see the eyes turn to me and I figure it’s time for a handshake. We exchange names and it’s all good. I’m actually not freaking out and losing my shit these days—I don’t really get nervous around girls anymore, it’s just that my approach anxiety comes from the fact that I think I can’t hold an interaction, that I’d come off looking completely weird and autistic lol even though I’m actually hyper-calibrated and can sense extremely subtle social cues.</p>
<p>But wait. It gets better.</p>
<p>After that convo, we go back to dancing around and dude, my wing is ON FIRE. He’s walking around with an unlit cigar in his mouth lookin’ all cool ’n shit. There’s a few “hired guns” in the nurse uniforms chatting. I’m standing aside and just watching him as he rolls in, opens a stunning one, chats a bit and takes her little nurse hat, y’know, the white one with a red cross on the front. He puts it on his head and we proceed to walk around the club with him looking like the coolest motherfucker there. I’m excited as fuck to have a dude this cool on my side. But I want a piece of that pie too.</p>
<p>He returns it to her shortly thereafter and we get back to derping around.</p>
<h2 id="my-very-first-club-open">My Very First Club Open</h2>
<p><em>…and a real man’s blowout.</em></p>
<p>We spot the main instructor in the back and we go to him to see what’s up. He has a FUCKING LASER POINTER and I see him sending dudes into sets he points at. It’s so absurd and awesome.</p>
<p>We walk up to him and he sends my wing to a lone chick at a nearby table. My wing walks off as if he sent him to just grab some free pussy; oh, no big deal—dude just fucking goes.</p>
<p>Oh shit, it’s my turn now.</p>
<p>He looks at me, takes his laser pointer and points to the two bitchiest looking chicks I’ve seen all night at a table next to my wing’s set.</p>
<p>I am confused as I give him that look like “dude, seriously? Me? Into THAT set?”</p>
<p>Yup. He pats me on the back and points toward them saying “go.”</p>
<p>My heart fucking sinks.</p>
<p>“Oh my god what do I do, oh man, oh man, oh shit…” I am starting to panic.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that I’ve never done a cold approach <em>in a club</em>. This would be my very first one.</p>
<p>I realize there’s no way out—he’s the fucking instructor and a god for me here and if I wanna learn a damn thing, I have to just surrender to what he says. I purposely rationalize that there’s no way out.</p>
<p>I look over at the set and I realize what am I about to do. I AM FREAKING THE FUCK OUT; my amygdala has fired up a massive stress response in my body.</p>
<p>I start walking toward ’em and I realize they’ve seen me and I really have no choice anymore—it’s clear I’m approaching them.</p>
<p>In all that mental chaos and confusion, I quickly manage to put on some shitty, super fake alpha body language. I cringe at my lame attempt to look cool. It’s absurdly pathetic, but fuck it, they’ve already seen thru it.</p>
<p>I stop in front of them and I have no fucking clue what to say. My mind is as blank as my non-existent list of chicks I banged.</p>
<p>I stand there as if I’m waiting for them to say something. Nothing. Bitchy looks are going strong.</p>
<p>Still standing there—still nothing. Oh. My. God.</p>
<p>About three full seconds later, I finally muster something up and I put my hand out to the chick closest to me to do a handshake.</p>
<p>Nope. That ain’t gonna cut it either. They’re totally unreactive. Bitchy looks still going strong.</p>
<p>Through my facial expressions and body language express something like “well, I guess that’s that, peace out then” and I walk off.</p>
<p>I. Am. Terrified. Emotionally scarred. I feel like a part of my soul has been ripped the fuck away from me into oblivion. I will never be the same man again. I run off into the crowd to “hide from them” lolwut</p>
<p>I’m still freaking out and thinking about what the fuck just happened.</p>
<p>A minute or two later, suddenly, words of my masters come into my mind. I hear Julien’s words from one of his most influential videos for me, his AA antidote video: “That fundamental core piece of who you are will always remain the same regardless of the external” or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I take a look at myself and see that I’m totally fine. My body’s here, I’m physically completely fine, my DICK is still here. Guess fucking what?? IT’S ALL GOOD!</p>
<p>I realize that I actually got blown out like a fucking man. My very first club open went like this? Fuck. Yes. I want more. If this is how easy it is to get rejected, sign me up for more. Emotionally it fucking hurts like hell, but eventually emotions fade and all that remains is the afterglow of glory and pure self-esteem for stepping up and taking it as a man.</p>
<p>For the rest of the night, my emotions are telling me to avoid these women, but I know how fucking awesome this was. This was THE reference experience I was looking for. I got blown out SO HARD and it hurt SO MUCH, yet in reality, I am COMPLETELLY UNAFFECTED by it. I am as perfectly fine as I was a minute before that rejection. In fact, I’m even fucking BETTER now.</p>
<h2 id="the-fucking-edge">The Fucking Edge</h2>
<p><em>I digress a bit…</em></p>
<p>I love the fucking game, man, it’s crazy. I lack the words to describe how much I love this shit.</p>
<p>There are days where I am a complete stimulation-seeking pathetic sack of shit and I don’t leave my little cave for days—but then there’s days like this. There’s days where I want to die for just a moment of living on THE FUCKING EDGE. All you hustlers out there know EXACTLY what I meant the moment I said “The Fucking Edge”. You resonate with it deep in your core as a fucking man if you’ve ever been there.</p>
<p>That feeling of riding the very edge of life, of comfort, that place where you are a fucking nanometer from giving up, you’re bleeding and cursing yourself why the fuck did you even get into this situation, that place where you feel like DYING just to end the pain—BUT YOU FUCKING DON’T and you PUSH THROUGH. That very place, that very fucking Edge of giving up—but not—is why I do this shit. It’s what makes me wake up every morning and go to my shitty job, it’s what I live for and it’s what’s gonna kill me one day. Life ain’t worth living if it ain’t on that fucking Edge.</p>
<p>A warrior’s life is a tough one, but it’s worth bleeding for it all.</p>
<p>I’m willing to sacrifice everything, and I mean EVERYTHING for this shit. I couldn’t give two shits about anything; the universe is an objective, logical and ruthless place. Who should give a shit, about anything, ever. It’s all fucking pointless.</p>
<p>In my most pathetic stimulation-seeking mood, I might disagree, but that’s just me veering off the path temporarily; sooner or later, I will find myself on the Edge again and I will be reminded of how it feels to LIVE there—permanently.</p>
<h2 id="my-wing-is-on-fire">My Wing is on Fire</h2>
<p>After my rejection, I recovered within just a few minutes. My wing comes from shortly thereafter and we chat about it a bit.</p>
<p>We’re walking around the club, just checking people out, chatting with dudes from the seminar and lovin’ it.</p>
<p>The action begins.</p>
<p>My wing is walking in front of me as we’re walking through the crowd.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I see him jump forward. He extends his arm through like two chodes that are trying to get close to this chick he just GRABS her by the neck from the side.</p>
<p>Holy fucking shit.</p>
<p>I see her turn towards us and smile. Damn. It’s immediately on. As we move closer, I see she’s with a friend.</p>
<p>My wing hits it off with his chick and it’s really good. But, of course, as always, I’m not doing shit, and so me and her friend are just dancing aside awkwardly as I look around trying to look as if I was oblivious to the whole thing that’s going down with the other two. I am very anxious now because I know it’s fucking obvious that I’m his chode buddy who doesn’t have balls to chat up the other girl lol</p>
<p>Eventually, though, they all start chatting and I again see those looks and I go in to introduce my self. “Finally, some free attention,” my poorly conditioned subconscious mind thinks as the anxiety drops.</p>
<p>But that was it, it got awkward again because I remained silent for the rest of the interaction, which lasted for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, we part and go back to derping around.</p>
<p>After a while, we leave the club and go to my wing’s car, I don’t remember why at the time of writing this, but we sit and chat about what went down tonight.</p>
<p>I look at the clock and it’s exactly 3:54AM as we’re talking about some David Deida shit, no-fap and criticize each other’s behaviors at the club.</p>
<p>We consider leaving or getting back to the club. We both fucking want more, the night is young and we gotta deal with some unfinished business.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<h2 id="my-second-open">My Second Open</h2>
<p><em>I can’t believe I had the balls for this…</em></p>
<p>We roll back in the club and that feeling of glory is present heavily.</p>
<p>We dance and derp around as usual as we walk around. We stand in one spot and think what should we do. I notice behind my wing is the first set that we opened tonight, that three-set I first talked about.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I realize I’m in state for a while already. The glory of the club and how far I’ve come since my shitty beginnings is really the core of what makes me feel good.</p>
<p>I feel no anxiety as I tell wing that we should go re-approach them.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember the exact feelings and thoughts I had on that walk towards the set. Here we are, two guys, hustlers, fucking bosses who go out, take massive action and actually (try to) pick up women, and that’s completely normal and assumed in our reality. I think of how far have I come and how fucking awesome I am. I feel incredible.</p>
<p>Surge of glory washes over me as we’re getting closer.</p>
<p>They are sitting on a ledge. There’s two chicks now in that set. Perfection.</p>
<p>We walk up and stand in front of them. They look up at us. We look at them.</p>
<p>I FEEL LIKE A GOD RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>Naturally, I do the most appropriate opener right now, The Hand of God. I am on cloud 9. I see my hand slowly move toward her. We have sharp eye contact and I have that sexy ass half-smirk on my face.</p>
<p>WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW FUCKING LEGENDARY I FEEL RIGHT NOW</p>
<p>As I’m writing this with some EDM playing on my head (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3JHH14xEoQ">Muzzy - Endgame</a>, if you care), I FEEL A FUCKING RAGING FIRE IN ME.</p>
<p>This fucking little window of time, these few hundred fucking precious milliseconds as we are standing in front of these women like gods.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE GREATEST MOMENT OF MY FUCKING LIFE.</p>
<p>I’ve lived for 20 years now and rare are the peak experiences that I’ve had, like getting drunk for the first time or hugging that hot friend of mine in high school while all my friends think we’re together and other similar things.</p>
<p>All of that shit pales in comparison to this. I can’t even begin to describe it. When you as a man, step up and EARN this moment for yourself, there’s just a whole new layer of glory that comes with that.</p>
<p>So, what happens next?</p>
<p>She looks sad. Like depressed and shit. On a sidenote, she’s not fat at all but a bit “curvy” if you will lol, but really fucking cute so I suspected at first she’s sad ’cause no one approached her maybe?</p>
<p>But she really does look legit sad and doesn’t take my hand. I kinda nod my head towards my hand like “grab it, girl”.</p>
<p>No workie. Aaaand my glory is over.</p>
<p>Instead of leaning in down to her as she’s sitting to start chatting, I didn’t do shit and just awkwardly stepped to the side.</p>
<p>My wing sat down and chatted with the other one. It went well and we left after a minute or so.</p>
<p>After some more dancing around, we decide to leave.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>As I’m about to start walking out, I look at the sky (remember, the place is roofless) with a full moon, it’s like 4:30am and dude… We dominated today. I take a moment and just stare at the sky, the dawn, and soak it all up. I know I won’t be back in this place for a long time. I look at the dancefloor, the women and the glory of it all, smile and walk out the happiest man ever.</p>
<p>My wing drops me off and as I’m walking home in the streets at 5am, it’s sunrise already and I just can’t express how amazing I feel.</p>
<p>I walk in my shithole apartment, look at myself in the mirror. One thing I’ve always kept in my mind is this quote RSD posted on Facebook a long time ago. It was something along the lines of “You can fool and lie to everyone, but you can’t lie to the man in the mirror.” I remember that and just fucking smile at myself.</p>
<p>I roll in my room, and after a few minutes of being happy as fuck and processing all this shit, I sit down, open my “puaJournal.txt”, break down the night in detail, have a bite of dark chocolate and some grass-fed butter, and then proceed to meditate.</p>
<p>I was riding the wave of my meditation habit and it eventually peaked at 56 days in a row. I had to stay at work ’till 7am one day so that fucked up the streak. But I jumped right back on it.</p>
<p>I learned a SHITTON from this night, so here’s the breakdown of the night, raw and unedited from my journal, just removed the names:</p>
<pre><code>[xx]062015 sat night -- FUCKING [club name] OH SHIET
