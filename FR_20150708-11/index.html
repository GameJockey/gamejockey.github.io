<p>Adapted, and slightly improved for readability, from my FRs thread on RSDNation.</p>
<p>Happened between July 8th–11th 2015, Wed–Sat.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Me and my wing have been going out like fucking crazy lately since he quit his job a few days ago. We had in mind to go out for four days straight from Wednesday to Saturday. We did, but my wing skipped Friday because he procrastinated on some college work to the very last moment and he had to get it done.</p>
<p>On Friday, nonetheless I took a walk to the club though and roamed the city a bit afterwards, but I arrived a fucking minute too late to get in the club for free. Tried convincing my wing to come out, but it didn’t work.</p>
<p>This Wednesday we began our gaming spree. I have been stealing every minute of my free time to nap because getting back home from partying at 6am and waking up at 7am for work a few days in a row is a bitch.</p>
<p>At this point my life is pretty much just game. Wake up for work at 7am, nap, game till 6am, repeat. On weekends, write field reports, write posts for my business blog IF I catch some time and, of course, game again.</p>
<p>I am having trouble recalling some unnecessary details of Wed and Thu nights because of so much craziness so I’m just writing a bit shorter reports (especially from Wed), but the important events and details are there.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday-my-wing-gets-a-makeout">Wednesday: My wing gets a makeout!</h2>
<p>We arrive at our favorite club, derp around, talk ’bout game and dance.</p>
<p>I’m unstifled and free as fuck as usual, but bored. I’m dancing and literally singing “this is fucking boring, this is fucking boring, yaaaaay”. I’m waiting for like 3:30am to hit because the BT gets super high and you can just jump around like fucking crazy. We’re supposed to be approaching, of course, but I’m not comfortable with that yet obviously.</p>
<p>My wing half-heartedly opens a few sets here and there and then we spot a two set. He goes in and I’m supposed to engage the friend. Guess what? I don’t, of course. I’m disappointed in myself as usual.</p>
<p>Luckily for my wing, some other dude swoops in and leads the friend somewhere away.</p>
<p>I’m dancing aside and just observing. He’s all over his chick physically and she’s hooked. Anime eyes, great reactions, he’s killing it. The interaction lasts about 25min altogether with breaks which makes it one of his longest AFAIK.</p>
<p>I go to the bar, order some sparkling water and just chill a bit. They walk up and me and his chick exchange names. A minute later, they fucking make out. Damn, son!</p>
<p>We leave the club shortly thereafter and run back to my place while it’s raining cats and dogs. We’re soaking wet. Fuck it. We sit in my wings car for a while and do a debrief. It was a not-that-awesome night for me, and a great one for my wing.</p>
<p>I didn’t took action and I’m disappointed as fuck but I learn a lot every single night and I’m slowly developing that urge to approach. I’m really close to actually opening, I often see sets and almost open ’em. It’s gonna happen, it’s inevitable. The leverage will tip the balance; the more disappointed I am in myself when I don’t do shit, the better.</p>
<p>But the next day… The next day was fucking tight.</p>
<h2 id="thursday-i-cant-even">Thursday: I can’t even…</h2>
<p>We’re dancing like crazy, literally yelling “FUCK YEAH, GAME!” and having a ball. Suddenly my wing opens this STUNNING fucking girl. I am looking at her and I can’t even.. High heels and her perfect face type make me lose my fucking mind.</p>
<p>They talk for like fifteen seconds and I see them both look towards me. We make eye contact. My mind melts from her beauty.</p>
<p>She straight up walks towards me and starts dancing with me with a smile. I’m like “what the fuck is going on??” Little did I know what my wing told her, he also didn’t really like her so he just threw her at me… Keep reading, you’ll find out.</p>
<p>I realize the interaction has started. I smile and dance with her as adrenaline starts flooding my bloodstream.</p>
<p>As we’re dancing, I’m completely on autopilot. I have no control over myself; I don’t know what the fuck am I doing—I am too overwhelmed to have a controlled conscious thought.</p>
<p>I suddenly see my hand go towards her and I take her left hand and spin her. She spins, looks at me and smiles. Oh my god…</p>
<p>She’s hooked as fuck. She loves me. I love her.</p>
<p>“Oh my god I am dancing with a stunning chick, FUCK YEAH, THE GAME!”, I think to myself.</p>
<p>I realize I gotta do some shit. My autopilot behavior for such situations is to exchange names. I gesture my hand to call her closer. We lean in, get close to each other and dudes, I can’t tell you how sexy she is.</p>
<p>I ask “what’s your name?”. As I wait for a response in this brief pause, I can’t help but just enjoy her right here, right now, next to me. I now know what it feels like to be this close with a girl.</p>
<p>She looks at me with a glaring smile and says her name. I smile and we briefly hold eye contact for what felt like forever.</p>
<p>I give her my name and as we go back to dancing, I spin her one more time. She’s loving it, but I realize I’m about to lose her attention if I don’t do more and if I don’t initiate a conversation and/or get physical.</p>
<p>I suddenly remember the spin handshake-to-hug move where you bring her arm around your neck after the spin so you’re really up close. This is the one move that I’ve practiced shitloads.</p>
<p>I think to myself, “fuck it, this is it” and do it.</p>
<p>Now here’s where I fuck up. I grab her LEFT hand instead of right, and as I spin her, I realize I can’t bring her arm around my neck for a hug. Well, shit..</p>
<p>We keep dancing and I see I’m close to losing her attention. She’s dancing like crazy right in front of me, looking right in my eyes with a gorgeous smile and obviously anticipating my next move kinda like “c’mon bro, show me your game, I’m ready”</p>
<p>She raises her hands in the air as she dances. In the midst of my mental chaos, I figure I’ll do the same and grab her hands.</p>
<p>So I do. And here I am now.</p>
<p>Time fucking freezes—I am in heaven as we’re holding our hands and having that intense intimate eye contact.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE GREATEST MOMENT OF MY FUCKING LIFE.</p>
<p>I know I constantly say this in my reports, but that’s because I keep pushing it higher every damn time.</p>
<p>I really can’t express how amazing this is.</p>
<p>This is the most sexy and intimate moment I’ve ever had. I have tasted what the game is really about.</p>
<p>What it feels like to have a fucking real stunning woman right up-close in your face giving you that sexy eye contact.</p>
<p>I am hooked for life; this pickup shit is worth it ALL. The Game will be my undoing. I don’t even give a shit. I’ll do anything to get good at this shit; sacrifice EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>I can’t even begin to imagine the highs that I will experience on my journey.</p>
<p>As we’re still holding hands, I fully lose myself in her gorgeous eyes. I don’t want this moment to end—ever. I wanna stay in Wonderland.</p>
<p>This is the very thing I’ve been chasing my whole life. I am in ecstasy.</p>
<p>We slowly put our hands down and keep dancing, but I’m noticing she’s kinda starting to look around; she’s losing attention.</p>
<p>I need to do something, but at this point, my mind is a complete fucking clusterfuck. I am under the influence of adrenaline and I’m high out of my mind from this incredible intimacy with her.</p>
<p>People do drugs? Fuck that shit yo, the game brings the greatest highs one can possibly even imagine, and it comes with true fulfillment as a bonus.</p>
<p>I can’t come up with anything. I look down at her body and remember I should be physical, I should grab her by her side and get in close. But at this point it’s a bit late, I think and just don’t do shit.</p>
<p>It starts fizzling out massively, and I spot my wing coming back from his set. I quickly tell him, “dude, talk to her” or something along those lines. I am way too mindfucked and overwhelmed to proceed. This is just too much too soon for me—just the way it should be all the time. It’s that fucking edge I talked about in my last FR. My every night needs to feel like that.</p>
<p>I literally don’t remember what happened next. I know about a minute later she was on her phone and sitting at a nearby table and I’m back to dancing with my wing.</p>
<p>What he told her and what made her come to dance with me was the following.</p>
<p>He told her that basically I just broke up with my GF and consequently invited him out to go pickup chicks. Then he told her to go and entertain me and tell me some jokes to cheer me up. What in the actual fuck lol?! How did he come up with that, I don’t know, but it’s fucking ingenious. I guess she loved the idea of that.</p>
<p>So that was Thursday for me. My greatest night so far in terms of reference experiences, but not action-taking. I keep pushing the boundary every damn time.</p>
<p>I came home feeling high as fuck and wrote a massive two page breakdown. I have never learned so much; this is crazy.</p>
<p>Also, today marks exactly the 30th day of my perfect daily meditation streak. A little cherry on top of a glorious night.</p>
<p>Remember fellas—what one man can do, another man can do. Fucking live by it like I do. The glory is to be had.</p>
<p>Peace out</p>
