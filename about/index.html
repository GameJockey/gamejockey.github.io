    <h1>About</h1>
<p>This site is a collection of my experiences in &ldquo;the game&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s known in the pickup community. It&rsquo;s about my experiences of going out and striving to get better with women.</p><p>Some of my older writings sorta suck a bit, but I&rsquo;m trying to get better with each new piece. Hope you enjoy my work, I&rsquo;ve put a lot of love and pain into not only writing this, but going out and <em>living</em> this.</p><p>You can find me on <a href="http://rsdnation.com">RSDNation</a> forums by my name GameJockey.</p><p>Don't hesitate to contact me for whatever reason (writing critique, you need a wing, comments and opinions, etc.).</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p>PS. I am staying anonymous here, but my IRL wings know about this. If you wanna meet me, invite me to game with you if you&rsquo;re in the area ;)</p>
