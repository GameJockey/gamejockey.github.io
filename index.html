<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I'm GameJockey, and I am a pickup artist.</p>
<p>These are my field reports (FRs). They are memoirs of my experiences out there in the field, doing game, talking to women, and doing my best to learn as much as possible and get better at it; to master the art of socializing and seduction. I came far, and I still have long ways to go.</p>
<p>I used to live in a big city and do cold approach then (during 2015, look for those FRs). Now I'm in a small town so I do social circle game.</p>
<p>Some experiences are written the very night they happened, while others much later, and unfortunately, fuzzy memory doesn't make for excellent writing. I regret this. </p>
<p>Thanks, and enjoy my work.</p>
