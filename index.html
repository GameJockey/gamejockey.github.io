<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I'm GameJockey, and I am a pickup artist.</p>
<p>These are my field reports (FRs). They are memoirs of my experiences out there in the field, doing game, talking to women, and doing my best to learn as much as possible and get better at it; to master the art of socializing and seduction. I came far, and I still have long ways to go.</p>
<p>I used to live in a big city and do cold approach then (during 2015, look for those FRs). Now I'm in a small town so I do social circle game.</p>
<p>Some experiences are written the very night they happened, while others much later, and unfortunately, fuzzy memory doesn't make for excellent writing. I regret this. </p>
<p>Thanks, and enjoy my work.</p>

<h5>Writings</h5>

<h5>News</h5>
<p>I've been working on an "overview of 2016" type of field report. It's mostly about my experiences with Amy, the girl featured in the field report "<a href="/FR_20160808">A Night To Remember</a>". I've spent almost every night of the last few months of 2016 with her and she changed my life in terms of game in profound ways. The field report will be amazing, just wait for itâ€”it's a long and wild story.</p>
